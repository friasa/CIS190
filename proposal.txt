Summary:
Our project is a scheduling app. It takes in a list of people looking
to take certain classes, a list of classes, and each person's list of preferences
over the list of classes as arguments. The app takes this list of student and 
their preferences and using the Deferred Acceptance algorithm, outputs 
the socially optimal list of classes and which students are in them. 
It can also be generalized take in any list of activites and people 
wanting to participate in them, and compute the socially optimal matching. 

Description:
The program will prompt the user for a list of activities, and a list 
of students, each with a list of preferences over the list of activites. 
If the input is not valid, the program will output a usage statement.
Otherwise, the program will take in the inputs and compute the socially 
optimal list. The program outputs a list of students and the 
classes they are in. This enables the program to compute 
the optimal matching for the students but not the classes,
due to the nature of the Deferred Acceptance Algorithm. 

Tasks:
1. Design and implement the matching algorithm (Alex F.)
2. Design and implement the underlying class components (Alex P.)
3. Design and implement the user-interface (Alex F.)
4. Debug and optimize (Both)

Alpha goals:
1. Have the matching algorithm implemented
2. Have the class components and user-interface designed
