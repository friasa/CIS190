/* Deferred Acceptance Algorithm
 * Authors: Alex Frias and Alex Peckman
 * Description: The deferred acceptance algorithm is a matching 
 *     algorithm that takes in a two groups, x and y, and a list of 
 *     preferences from x over the other group, y. It then 
 *     computes the socially optimal stable matching for x. 
 * Dependencies:
 *     A list x 
 *     A list y
